# Generate HEX Color.

HEX color means like <code>#ff0000</code>.

A hexadecimal color is specified with: `#RRGGBB`, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

## HEX Value

In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

**#rrggbb**

- Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

- For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).

- To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.

- To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.

- Experiment by mixing the HEX values [here]():
